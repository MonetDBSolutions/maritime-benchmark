	- Cut the ship ammount (5-10) and the date (1 day)

Query
	- Make a trajectory for a certain ship (st_collect) -> fun(mmsi:int) 
	- Ship distance to a port or to a ship (st_distance) -> fun(mmsi:int, portid:int) / fun(mmsi1:int, mmsi2:int)
	- Ship distance to a port or to a ship (st_distance) -> fun(mmsi:int, time:ts, portid:int, interval) / fun(mmsi1:int, time:ts, mmsi2:int, interval) -> Can also do with trajectories
	- All ports/ships which are at certain distance from a certain ship trajectory (st_dwithin) -> fun(mmsi:int, portid:int, distance:dbl)
	- Which ship trajctories intersect with a certain EEZ (st_intersects) -> fun(eez_id:int)
